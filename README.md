# Waylander

A utility for managing monitor setups on Linux. Intended as a modern replacement for `xrandr` and `arandr` for Wayland. Under construction.

## Motivation

I frequently switch my monitor setup between my desktop monitor and TV. Previously I used some `xrandr` scripts, but switched to Wayland some time ago. I wasn't happy with the existing replacements for Wayland so I decided to make something better for myself.

I'm not concerned with compatibility with older tools or trying to keep the tool super-minimal. If there are desired features that make sense to implement, I'd be happy to incorporate them into Waylander.

## Supported platforms (so far)
- Gnome Wayland

## Todo list
- [ ] Basic documentation
- [ ] Ensure cloning works properly
- [ ] KDE support
- [ ] GUI
- [ ] Audio devices
